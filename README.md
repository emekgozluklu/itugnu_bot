<h1> itugnu_bot </h1>

# Commands;

## /misyon   :
Sends the mission and vision of the Free Software Club. The content is about what are we doing and what will we do.

## /events   :
Sends the oncoming events and lectures.

## /addevent : 
You can create an event by only talking with itugnu_bot. When you send this command, it will ask you for the password. If the password is correct, then asks for the event name and date. Writes them to database and runs the /events command finally. It is not going to work if you are on a group chat and send a error message.

## /timeout username duration :
itugnu_bot bans the user with given username for given seconds. Only admins can restrict a user and it works on supergroups only.
